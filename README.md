jgeohash
========

An easy-to-implement library that can assist Java developers in using the GeoHash algorithm in order to create geocodes based on custom latitude and longitude values.

With the help of jGeohash, software developers will be able to quickly and easily generate a geohash code using user-defined latitude and longitude values. By using the GeoHash algorithm, the space can be divided into multiple grid shapes.

This library is a basic implementation from the GeoHash algorithm written in the java can be used to generate from the latitude and longitude a geohash code and reverse. 

The library is kept simple and have no dependencies to other libraries.
